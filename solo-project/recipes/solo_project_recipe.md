# {{PROBLEM}} Method Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices.

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes.

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to see an itemised receipt with a grand total.

Use the twilio-ruby gem to implement this next one. You will need to use doubles too.

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered.

## 2. Design the Method Signature

_Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to
focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below
uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com_



```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# `extract_upper` extracts uppercase words from a list of words
uppercase_words = extract_uppercase(mixed_words)

mixed_words: a string (e.g. "hello WORLD")
uppercase_words: a list of strings (e.g. ["WORLD"])

# The method doesn't print anything or have any other side-effects
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the method will take and return._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

extract_uppercase("hello WORLD") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("HELLO WORLD") => ["HELLO", "WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("hello world") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WoRLD") => []
extract_uppercase("hello WORLD!") => ["WORLD"]
extract_uppercase("") => []
extract_uppercase(nil) throws an error
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
